<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am an undergrad at Stanford University studying Electrical Engineering. I enjoy building rockets, among other things. I am passionate about equal access to computing, preventing the exploitation of human weaknesses, sustainability, and human spaceflight. In the future, I hope to advance the state of human evolution by contributing to one of these ends.</p>

<p>I believe that even as access to computing has skyrocketed in recent decades, inequal access to computing remains as great an issue as ever before. This is particularly true today, as computers become powerful enough to exploit the vulnerabilities of human thinking, yet this power remains in the hands of only a few. Until we better understand the consequences, we should be wary of having supercomputers engaged in tight feedback loops with our brains, particularly when the computer's interests do not align with our own.</p>

<p>I also believe that if we can dramatically reduce the cost of access to space, then that will not only result in a technological revolution in space, but it will also let us look back at the Earth and become more reflective on our place in the universe, and be better towards ourselves and our planet.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite books are Permutation City, Snow Crash, Ready Player One, and Red Mars. If you have some time, I would have to recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/yqmfrqAVeK0">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)</a> (this is great if you've ever had to read Shakespeare in school), <a href="https://youtu.be/QHPmRJIoc2k">Tom Lehrer's 1967 Copenhagen Performance</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite game is Team Fortress 2, in which I have amassed countless hours of play time. Rocket jumping has consistently been one of my favorite things to do in TF2. <a href="https://youtu.be/3hflXwY_bPo">Here</a> is a brief video of some of the better rocket jumps I have managed to pull off.</p>
